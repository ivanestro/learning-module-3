## INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC AND LOOPS - CONTROL STRUCTURES: 

- Control Structures are essential in programming because they allow you to control the flow of your code. 

- There are three types of control strucutres: Sequential, selection and iteration.

1. Sequential statements are executed in the order they are written
2. Selection statements are executed based on a condition. 
3. Iteration statements are executed repeatedly.

- Control structures enable you to create more complex programs that can perform different tasks based on specific conditions.

## INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC AND LOOPS - PYTHON CONTROL STRUCTURES 

- In Python the primary control structures are conditional statements and loops.

- Conditional statements allow your program to make decision based on specific conditions, leading to different outcomes. 
1. "If it is raining outside, I will grab an umbrella" (otherwise I will not)
2. "If it is a weekday, I will wake up at 6am, otherwise I will wake up at 8am"

- Loops enable you to perform the same operation multiple times without writing the same code repeatedly, making your code more efficent and easier to maintain.
1. "For each grocery item on the conveyer belt I will: grab it, scan it, put it in a bag."
2. "As long as the pool is not filled, I will add water to it."

## INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC AND LOOPS - PROPER INDENTATION 

- In python indentation is essential for defining code blocks within control structues, loops and functions. 
1. By adding indentation, we seperate the code into sections and subsections.

- Unlike other programming languages that use brackets or keyboard to denote code blocks, python relies on indentation.
1. Proper indentation improves code readability and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

## PYTHON CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

- Conditional Statements allow your program to make decision based on specific conditions. 

- Python has three keyboards for this purpose:

1. "If": evaluates a condition and executes the following code block if the condition is True. 
* "If it is Friday Sept.29th then there are no classes"

2. "elif": (else if ): checks another condition if the previous if statement is False 
* "else if it October 31st then we eat candy"
* You can have multiple elif statements.

3. "else": executes the code block if none of the previous conditions are True.
* "else/otherwise, we go to classes and work on our assignments"

## IF STATEMENT

- Go to the #Conditionals placeholder in the given file and add this if-statement

- What will this code do?
- Note: age is a given variable with a value of 18:
- if age < 13: 
    print("Child")

## IF-ELSE STATEMENT

- Modify the statement to add the else block:
- What will this code do?
- Note: age is a given variable with a value of 18:

``` csharp
    ""if age < 13: 
    print("Child") else: print("Teen or Adult")}
```
